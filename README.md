This project is a Texas Hold'em  
project written in Rust.  
Currently, it compiles with no warnings and 
so far it does what it needs to do.  
The program currently has a main, and a library called game,  
which contains the Rust files used in the program. 
Feel free to view these files and give comments 
on how they can be improved.
