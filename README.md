This project is a Texas Hold'em  
project written in Rust. So far,  
this is a prototype and only mostly,  
if not completely done. Currently, it compiles
with no warnings and so far it does what it  
needs to do. The program currently has a main,
and a library called files, which contains the Rust  
files used in the program. Feel free to view these  
files and give comments on how they can be improved.
